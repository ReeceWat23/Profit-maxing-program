1. define our problem and what we want to do "maximize profits"
2. get the name of the first product that we want to use (using the get lp_variable function and prompt_prod function)
3. get the name of the second product that we want to use (using the get lp_variable function and prompt_prod function)
4. Get the limit of the first resource
5. get the constraint for the first product of for this resource
6. get the constraint for the second product of for this resource
7. Get the limit of the second resource
8. get the constraint for the first product of for this resource
9. get the constraint for the second product of for this resource
10. Get the desired profit for the first product and second product (using the get_objective function)
11. define constraint 1
12. define constraint 2
13. solve the problem using .solve
14. Print out the status of our problem
15. get the solution values for our problem and store it in a variable "value"
16. print the optimal value
17. print the value for product 1
18. print the value for product 2
